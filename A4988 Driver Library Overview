BasicStepperDriver Class
This is a generic stepper motor driver class that provides core functionalities:

1. Initialization and Configuration
   - begin(float rpm=60, short microsteps=1): Initializes the motor pins and configures the motor RPM and microstepping.
   - setRPM(float rpm): Sets the target RPM for the motor.
   - setMicrostep(short microsteps): Configures the microstepping level.

2. Speed Profiles
   - setSpeedProfile(Mode mode, short accel=1000, short decel=1000): Configures acceleration and deceleration in steps per second squared.
   - getSpeedProfile(): Retrieves the current speed profile.

3. Motor Movement
   - move(long steps): Moves the motor a given number of steps (positive for forward, negative for reverse).
   - rotate(long deg): Rotates the motor a given number of degrees (integer precision).
   - rotate(double deg): Rotates the motor with sub-degree precision.
   - startMove(long steps, long time=0): Starts a movement over a given number of steps.
   - startRotate(long deg | double deg): Starts a rotational movement.
   - move() is blocking, startMove() is non blocking and needs to call nextAction each loop.

4. Control and State
   - enable(), disable(): Enables or disables the motor to allow free movement or hold its position.
   - stop(): Stops the motor immediately and returns the remaining steps.
   - startBrake(): Initiates braking and stops the motor.
   - nextAction(): Performs the next step in a non-blocking move and returns the time until the next action.
   - getCurrentState(): Retrieves the current state of movement (stopped, accelerating, cruising, decelerating).

5. Utility Functions
   - calcStepsForRotation(long deg | double deg): Calculates the steps needed to rotate a specified angle.
   - getTimeForMove(long steps): Estimates the time required to complete a movement.
   - getStepsCompleted(), getStepsRemaining(): Retrieves the completed or remaining steps for the current move.

A4988 Class
This is a subclass of BasicStepperDriver, tailored for the A4988 stepper motor driver:

1. Initialization
   - Overloaded constructors for different wiring configurations:
     - Only DIR and STEP pins connected.
     - Adding an ENABLE pin.
     - Fully wired with microstepping pins (MS1, MS2, MS3).

2. Microstepping
   - setMicrostep(short microsteps): Configures the microstepping mode (1:1 to 1:16).
   - getMicrostepTable(), getMicrostepTableSize(): Accesses the microstep resolution table.
   - getMaxMicrostep(): Retrieves the maximum supported microstep level.

3. Control
   - begin(float rpm, short microsteps): Initializes pins and configurations for motor operation.
   - Supports microstepping resolution through MS1, MS2, and MS3 pins.

Key Features and Differences
- The BasicStepperDriver provides the foundational operations for any generic stepper motor, including movement, speed control, and acceleration profiles.
- The A4988 adds specific support for the A4988 driver, including microstepping resolution control via hardware pins.
